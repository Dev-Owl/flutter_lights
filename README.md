# PLEASE READ ME
* The code (very likely) will not work with the current stable version of Flutter
* The code is by far not ready for production or was tested properly
* We created this as a quick demo/hack once the first shader support was added to Flutter early 2022
* We do not plan to work on this, feel free to experiment with the code
* The code was published because member of the Flutter/Flame Community have requested it
